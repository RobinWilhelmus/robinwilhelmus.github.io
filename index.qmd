### Welcome!


My name is Robin Koetsier. This site serves as a personal site for my data and blog posts. (Very much still work in progress)

I mostly write about Dutch football. On my Twitter profile you can follow me for visualizations of Eredivisie matches and other stuff. Besides that, I wrote some shiny apps that you can find under the link to my work stuff.
